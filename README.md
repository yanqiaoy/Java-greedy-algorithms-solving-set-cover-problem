# Java-greedy-algorithms-solving-set-cover-problem

In this project, you will implement the greedy algorithms in Section 2 to solve the wSCP integer programming
problem. You will compare the performance of the algorithms using the following three metrics;

Final objective function value;
Feasibility of the final solution (element coverage);
Computation time needed for the algorithm to run;
